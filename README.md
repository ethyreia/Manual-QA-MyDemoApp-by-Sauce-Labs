# mydemoapp-qa

this repository contains the manual quality assurance documentation for the MyDemoApp e-commerce platform. the project demonstrates a systematic approach to verifying core application features and ensuring a stable user experience.

the primary deliverable is a Microsoft Excel workbook that serves as the central testing repository. this document includes a comprehensive test plan, step-by-step test cases, and a detailed defect tracker used to log and categorize issues found during execution.

testing focused on critical user paths such as account authentication, product navigation, shopping cart functionality, and the final checkout process. each scenario was evaluated for functional accuracy and interface consistency.

the results documented in the workbook provide a clear view of the application's current state, highlighting specific areas where the actual behavior diverged from the expected requirements. this project showcases the ability to analyze complex workflows and provide clear, actionable feedback for software improvement.
